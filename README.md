# MacOSX-Fennec-theme
Mac OS X linux theme, 10.5/10.6/era. 
Mac OS X fennec is a icon theme, intending to emulate the Mac OS X leopad era of mac OS X, aka the pre yosemete look.
I didn't make these icons of course, the GTK theme included is; not-mac for window controls, Leopad-master for the theme.
